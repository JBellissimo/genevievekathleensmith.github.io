<h3><a name="cryptic-coexistence" class="anchor" href="#cryptic-coexistence"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Measuring Niche Overlap in a Cryptic Species Complex.</h3>
<p>Most ecological theory is built on the idea that species must occupy different niches in order to coexist with one another. However, there are plenty of instances where highly similar species can be found together. Are they really coexisting? Are there subtle niche differences at work? Or is their co-occurrence merely a transient state?</p>
<p>Using a group of freshwater crustacean species (Hyalella azteca amphipods), that can only be identified using genetic tools, we can start to assess just how similar co-occurring competitors can be.</p>
<p>Using experimental mesocosms I hope to determine just how important the observed niche differences are between these species for maintaining their co-occurrence. This work was done at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan State University.</p>

<h3><a name="morphology" class="anchor" href="#morphology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flight Apparatus Shapes in a Sexually Polymorphic Damselfly.</h3>
<p>Many species of damselflies are sexually dimorphic, meaning they have different-looking males and females. In some cases there are many different kinds of female morphs, and often one of the female morphs resembles the male type in many features. One example of this occurs in Ischnura ramburii, a damselfly species native to North America that invaded the Hawaiian islands sometime in the 20th century. We wanted to know if in addition to having male-like pigmentation and sometimes behaving like male damselflies, whether or not these male-mimicking females also had wings shaped like males. After measuring wing shapes from individuals collected throughout the Hawaiian archipelago as well as in part of their native range, we found that female wings are largely all the same. This suggests that the demands of being a female damselfly (mainly carrying around eggs) overrides any other forces that would tend to select for more male-like flight apparatus.</p>

<h3><a name="shakespeare" class="anchor" href="#shakespeare"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building a New Timeline for Shakespeare’s Plays.</h3>
<p>Within the 10-syllable structure of the iambic pentameter there may be pauses, either commas, colons, semi-colons, or perhaps a full stop, followed by another character picking up where the first left off. Interestingly, the relative positions of these pauses are not random throughout the text of Shakespeare’s plays. Instead, they tend to most often occur after the 4th and 6th syllables. And furthermore, the proportion of pauses in each position changes across the plays as Shakespeare’s style evolved over time. Although we have a good idea ofwhen Shakespeare lived and worked, we actually don’t know the exact dates of when each of his plays were written. Using the pause patterns to group plays with similar structure, we can put the plays in order. Remarkably, this ordering fits very well with previously-known dates, and in the cases where we see divergence there is perhaps a case to be made for a revision.</p>
<p>the proportion of pauses at each position (after the first syllable, after the second, and so on) changes throughout Shakespeare’s plays. Plays are ordered according to the standard chronology scholars generally agree upon. Notice how he uses mostly 4th-position pauses in his early plays and shifts to more 6th-position pauses later on.</p>
<p>We can summarize most of the variation across plays by recasting the raw data using Correspondence Analysis (which is similar to the more-familiar Principal Components Analysis, but more appropriate for count data). Using a version of this approach (called Constrained Correspondence Analysis) we can generate a timeline based on the pause count data. It agrees well with the accepted dates for many plays, but in some cases there are discrepancies.</p>

<h3><a name="resilience" class="anchor" href="#resilience"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Forest Resilience to Large-Scale Clearing.</h3>    
<p>Existing public databases from long-term ecological research stations provide great opportunities for asking biological questions at large spatial and temporal scales, such as: How do whole ecosystems respond to disturbance events? Do different aspects of community structure and ecosystem function respond in different ways? Or at different scales?
<p>Our first step was to assemble a data set from the Hubbard Brook Research Forest website, which required combining data collected over many decades, under different sampling regimes, at multiple sites using publicly-available raw files.</p>
<p>We re-analyzed data from a deforestation experiment at the Hubbard Brook Research Forest and included new addition to standard measures of diversity and structure, we incorporated phylogenetic information and species trait data into our analysis. Our goal was to determine whether the resilience of individual ecosystem properties (i.e. the restoration of species diversity to pre-disturbance levels) is similar or whether aspects of the system return at different rates, have differing levels of initial displacement, or find their way back to different equilibria. Using a Bayesian approach to fit damped-oscillator models to the data, we found that while diversity and biomass appear to simply asymptotically approach pre-disturbance values, other metrics exhibit varied behavior, in both the amplitude and frequency of oscillations, suggesting a more nuanced view of ecosystem resilience.</p>
