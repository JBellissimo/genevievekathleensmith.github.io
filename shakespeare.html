<h3><a name="shakespeare" class="anchor" href="#shakespeare"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building a New Timeline for Shakespeare’s Plays.</h3>
<p>Within the 10-syllable structure of the iambic pentameter there may be pauses, either commas, colons, semi-colons, or perhaps a full stop, followed by another character picking up where the first left off. Interestingly, the relative positions of these pauses are not random throughout the text of Shakespeare’s plays. Instead, they tend to most often occur after the 4th and 6th syllables. And furthermore, the proportion of pauses in each position changes across the plays as Shakespeare’s style evolved over time. Although we have a good idea ofwhen Shakespeare lived and worked, we actually don’t know the exact dates of when each of his plays were written. Using the pause patterns to group plays with similar structure, we can put the plays in order. Remarkably, this ordering fits very well with previously-known dates, and in the cases where we see divergence there is perhaps a case to be made for a revision.</p>

<h5>Heatmap illustrating the proportional abundance of each pause type (1st through 9th position along each row) for all of Shakespeare's plays. Plays are ordered according to Oxford's <i>Textual Companion</i> (1987).</h5>
<p>The proportion of pauses at each position (after the first syllable, after the second, and so on) changes throughout Shakespeare’s plays. Plays are ordered according to the standard chronology scholars generally agree upon. Notice how he uses mostly 4th-position pauses in his early plays; for example, look at plays like <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> (SHR), <i>Henry VI, part III</i> (3H6), or <i>Love's Labour Lost</i> (LLL). In the middle part of his carrer, we see plays like <i>Hamlet</i> (HAM) and <i>Othello</i> (OTH) where there are two distinct peaks at the 4th and 6th position. By the time we reach his latest plays, including <i>Henry VIII</i> and <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, there is a clear shift to more 6th-position pauses.</p>

<h5>For each play we have plotted the relative abundance of each pause type. Plays are ordered chronologically in columns.</h5>
<p>We can summarize most of the variation across plays by recasting the raw data using Correspondence Analysis (which is similar to the more-familiar Principal Components Analysis, but more appropriate for count data). Using a version of this approach (called Constrained Correspondence Analysis) we can generate a timeline based on the pause count data. It agrees well with the accepted dates for many plays, but in some cases there are discrepancies.</p>
